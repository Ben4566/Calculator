# Calculator Project: Building a Scientific Calculator

Welcome to my Calculator Project! This repository contains the source code and documentation for my attempt to develop a feature-rich scientific calculator. This project serves as both a learning experience and a practical application of the knowledge I have acquired during my studies in planning, modeling, testing, and programming.

## What is the Project?

The goal of this project is to build a software-based scientific calculator that supports a wide range of mathematical and statistical operations. The focus is on accuracy, usability, and reliability. The application is designed to run with a graphical user interface (GUI).

---

## Features

The project aims to include the following functionalities:

- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Math Functions:** Trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, and more.
- **Input for Multiple Values and Operators:** Supporting complex calculations.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid inputs and mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero).

## What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?

The MVP for this project includes:

- A fully functional scientific calculator with a Swing-GUI.
- Support for basic arithmetic operations.
- Implementation of at least three advanced math functions (e.g., sine, logarithm, exponentiation).
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs and mathematical errors.

## Nice to Haves

Beyond the MVP, the following features would enhance the project:

- Additional statistical and scientific functions.
- Memory functions for storing and recalling multiple values.
- Advanced visualization features, such as graphing capabilities.
- A mobile app or web-based version of the calculator.

---

## Roadmap

Future improvements and features include:

- Expanded statistical and scientific functions.
- Development of a mobile app or web-based version of the calculator.
