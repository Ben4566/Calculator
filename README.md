# Calculator Project: Recreating the TI-30X Plus

Welcome to my Calculator Project! This repository contains the source code and documentation for my attempt to recreate the functionality of the TI-30X Plus calculator. This project serves as both a learning experience and a fun challenge to develop a feature-rich scientific calculator.

---

## What is the Project?

The goal of this project is to build a software-based scientific calculator that emulates the functionality of the TI-30X Plus. The calculator will support a wide range of mathematical and statistical operations, with a focus on accuracy and usability. It is designed to run as a command-line application, with with a graphical user interface.

## Features

The project aims to replicate the core functionalities of the TI-30X Plus calculator, including:

- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Math Functions:** Trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation, and more.
- **Statistical Operations:** Mean, variance, standard deviation, and other statistical computations.
- **Memory Functions:** Store and recall values.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of invalid inputs and mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero).

## What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?

The MVP for this project includes:

- A fully functional scientific calculator with a Swing-GUI.
- Support for basic arithmetic operations.
- Implementation of at least three advanced math functions (e.g., sine, logarithm, exponentiation).
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs and mathematical errors.

## Nice to Haves

Beyond the MVP, the following features would enhance the project:

- Additional statistical and scientific functions.
- Memory functions for storing and recalling multiple values.
- Table-function of the TI-30X Plus.
- A mobile app or web-based version of the calculator.
